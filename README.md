This bug demonstrates a common error in Python: attempting to add an integer and a string.  The function `function` intends to add two numbers, but it receives an integer and a string. Python cannot directly perform this addition, hence the TypeError. The solution shows a way to address this by converting the string to an integer before performing the addition.
